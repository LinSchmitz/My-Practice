Perfect! Here’s a **focused 1-page practice plan** to strengthen your weak spots from this challenge. You can do this in **30–60 minutes**.

# **JavaScript Practice Plan – Targeted Exercises**

## **1️⃣ Spread & Rest Operator Practice**

**Goal:** Combine arrays and accept variable arguments in functions.

### Exercise 1 – Combine arrays

```js
// Create two arrays of fruits
const fruits1 = ['apple', 'banana'];
const fruits2 = ['orange', 'mango'];

// Combine into one array: allFruits
```

✅ Practice: Use **spread operator** to merge arrays

---

### Exercise 2 – Function with rest parameters

```js
// Write a function that accepts any number of numbers
// It should print each number and return their sum
```

✅ Practice: Use **rest parameters (`...nums`)** and a loop to process them

---

## **2️⃣ Short-circuiting (`&&` / `||`)**

**Goal:** Execute code conditionally without `if/else` or ternary.

### Exercise 3 – Conditional log with `&&`

```js
// Given a variable isOnline = true
// Print "User is online" using short-circuiting only
```

### Exercise 4 – Default values with `||` and `??`

```js
// Given let score = 0;
// Create a variable displayScore that uses a default of 10 if score is null or undefined
```

✅ Practice: See the difference between `||` and `??` for falsy vs nullish values

---

## **3️⃣ Follow Instructions Exactly**

**Goal:** Strengthen attention to small details.

### Exercise 5 – Include all elements

```js
// Given array mainPlayers = ['A', 'B', 'C']
// Add substitutes ['X', 'Y'] to create finalPlayers
// Make sure the original mainPlayers are included
```

### Exercise 6 – Function arguments

```js
// Write a function printNames that takes any number of names
// Prints each name and prints "Total names: X"
// Test with 3–5 names
```

✅ Practice: Translate instructions to exact code logic

---

## **4️⃣ Optional Mini Challenge – Combined Skills**

```js
// Given teams: ['Team1', 'Team2']
// Odds: { team1: 2, draw: 3, team2: 5 }
// Print which team is most likely to win using short-circuiting only
```

✅ Practice: Combine **rest/spread**, **short-circuiting**, and **reading instructions** carefully
